Last weekend I went to [Genehack](http://genehack.ru/){:target="_blank"} - annual bioinformatics hackathon held in Moscow. It was great!

This was my second attempt to take part in hackathon or hackathon-like event not remotely. There was almost no one person I know - for me it's hardest part.

This photo shows me and one of my teammates yesterday. Having almost no sleep for 2 days makes me look concentrated and pretty :)

Our team had to write a tool for predicting drug biomarkers in metabolic pathways from gene expression data for different cell lines (a project given by [Pepper Biology](http://pepperbiology.com/){:target="_blank"}). We tried to reproduce pipeline given in certain article, use different machine learning methods and then try to adopt it to different metabolic pathway database.

It took almost 2 days to figure out what authors of original study used for preprocessing, to repeat the same algorithm, to apply it to a smaller amount of data %) And anyway we didn't fit on time to predict something with our results.

It was very stressful, but interesting experience :) I like hackathons because they make me more productive and curious - especially when it turns out that there are many things I don't know yet. Hope it helps with my Outreachy internship, which officially started today!

We also won some prizes - coupons to internet shop (quite expensive shop, but with a lot different things - and books! - in stock). I want to spend it on biophysics book) Usually I read something freely-available or buy it on Amazon/O'Reilly and read in Kindle app (I realized that paper books are heaviest things in the world when me and my husband moved from Arkhangelsk to St.Petersburg), but recently I saw that book in local book store and fall in love =)

I have ordered one-way ticket to Moscow before hackathon because I didn't know what to expect - all project themes were kept in secret and were unknown before the event. At Sunday morning my husband found train ticket with quite discounted price and booked it for me - it was my first trip by [Grand-express](http://www.russiantrains.com/en/page/grand-express){:rel="nofollow", :target="_blank"} train. I felt myself like nouveau riche there - because of stable working  Wi-Fi and electrical socket in my compartment. Free breakfast was also included, but their coffee was not so great as one might expect. I read Debian-Med wiki for several hours there (to refresh things I learnt while applying to Outreachy), then fall asleep. Saint Petersburg woke me up with sunny morning, great coffee at the train station and optimism supercharge!
