Today my mentor Andreas Tille wrote me this inspiring letter<!--break-->:

    Hi Tanya,

    thanks for your very thorough work on all packages you are touching.
    I'm really happy that you are doing all the work (even the not so
    interesting one) on the packages you are touching.  That's really
    helpful.

    Please remember my suggestion to apply for Debian Maintainer.

    Kind regards

           Andreas.

    PS: Feel free to quote me in your outreachy blog.


It's very-very good and inspiring letter :)

But I'm still working on the same bunch of packages I started to work when I wrote [previous post]({% post_url 2016-06-23-outreachy-girl-meets-perl %}){:target="_blank"} (and left it in _drafts folder for a while - it seemed to be too emotional for that moment).

There are only 2 or 3 packages left, and these two are nastiest ones. I hope I'll finish them soon.

*Upd*. If you wonder what packages I worked on, read [this post]({% post_url 2016-07-17-outreachy-report %}){:target="_blank"}
