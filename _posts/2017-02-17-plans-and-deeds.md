Since last post many things happened.
I spent 1 week in Dolgoprudny, at [DeepHack - supercool school & hackathon on deep learning](http://deephack.me/){:target="_blank"}(this year the main theme was reinforcement learning). 
I should say that I wasn't very productive enough during hackathon, but it was a good opportunity to kick myself to read about new subject and to do something. 
And to travel to Moscow, of course!

The good thing is, during this hackathon I finally fixed the nasty bug in `metastudent` package I stucked with.
Hackathon week ended up with another event, which was more for newbies in machine learning like me - [DataFest conference](http://datafest.ru/){:target="_blank"}. I don't like big events with lot of people, but there were several ex-coworkers from BIOCAD and we met :)
Also my team took 3rd place at hackathon :)

I couldn't decide if I want to attend another event in Moscow - [Future biotech winter school](http://www.winter17.futurebiotech.ru/){:target="_blank"} and finally decided not to attend.
But I was lucky - the guys from Future Biotech decided to [stream lectures from school on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRYnTsVHYRqnqMl0253Pzg){:target="_blank"}. I spent this week watching these lectures :)

The next event is [Biohack](http://biohack.ru/){:target="_blank"} - bioinformatics hackathon in St.Petersburg, organized by my former MSc program mentors. I want to come there with my own project - deadline for project ideas is February, 22st.
I wanted to start to gather materials this week, but Future Biotech school lectures were very good, I watched Youtube stream and haven't start to dig through articles yet :) For now I have several ideas, but they are all technical. 

I have no concrete plans after this hackathon ends. I don't know what I will do next. And this is bad, but also totally exciting, in some way :)
