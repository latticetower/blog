Hello!

I am a small part of universe, bioinformatics newbie, bureaucracy agent, A.Tennysson poetry fan.

And this is just an About page. For my own evil purposes.

In fact, I haven't decided what to place here yet - this text copies slightly modified description from my previous main page.

You shouldn't be here, not now!

LYLAS \|\| LYLAB, me.

But if you insist...

[This wierd thing](../experiments/pdbatomic/viewer.html) draws lines obtained from .PDB data in "ATOM" section. To see something simply select local .pdb file.
  ".pdb" == special bioinformatics file format with protein information (you can find all details [here](ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/Format_v33_A4.pdf)).

You can open some of my hometasks on [NGS (Next Generation Sequencing)](../hometasks/NGS/3/hometask3.html) and [MSA (Molecular Sequence Analysis)](../hometasks/msa1/hometask.html). I made them with the help of markdown, and they look nice - the only reason why they are still here.
